/*
  There is some problem with sass parsing and our assets pipeline configuration that causes errors:
    Undefined variable: "$red".
      (in ...gems/rails_admin-0.0.1/app/assets/stylesheets/rails_admin/imports.css.scss.erb)

  This empty file is temp fix for that problem and it overwrites the rails_admin default css (We need to fix the problem to make the UI look ok)

/*
 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
 * listed below.
 *
 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,
 * or any plugin's vendor/assets/stylesheets directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
 * compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any styles
 * defined in the other CSS/SCSS files in this directory. It is generally better to create a new
 * file per style scope.
