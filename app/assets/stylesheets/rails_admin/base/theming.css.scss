  There is some problem with sass parsing and our assets pipeline configuration that causes errors:
    Undefined variable: "$red".
      (in ...gems/rails_admin-0.0.1/app/assets/stylesheets/rails_admin/imports.css.scss.erb)

  This empty file is temp fix for that problem and it overwrites the rails_admin default css (We need to fix the problem to make the UI look ok)
